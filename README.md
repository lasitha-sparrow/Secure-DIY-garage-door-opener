[![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lewispg228/Secure-DIY-garage-door-opener/master/thumbnail.jpg)](https://youtu.be/S7GRFRJbG7M)

Using the SparkFun Cryptographic Co-processor, we created a secure garage door opener! This repository contains the source code for both the remote control and the base transceiver.

At it's core, this project is a wire-less button controller. In this way, it could be used for many other applications. What might you like to use this security for?
